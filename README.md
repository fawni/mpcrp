## Disclaimer

Media and fanart detection is done through the [fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv) api. mpcrp might display irrelevant data, as it is impossible to 100% identify the correct media based on the filename alone.

> eg: a video named _cat.mp4_ will be assumed to be [Cat Planet Cuties](https://fanart.tv/series/173301/cat-planet-cuties/) as it is the first entry on fanart.tv that has a poster and is a tv show or a movie.

If fanart.tv does not recognize the filename, mpcrp will only display the filename along with basic metadata.
